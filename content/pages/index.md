    title: EASY AND FUN TO USE
    subtitle: ''
    text: >
      Diversion is for everybody. We believe that you don’t need to read a book
      just to use version control. Diversion has an intuitive interface that
      gives you everything you need without looking up commands or using cheat
      sheets. Focus on your code, not on your SCM.



      Diversion works with any IDE.

    title: BUILT FOR THE CLOUD AND CONTAINERS
    subtitle: ''
    text: >
      If you run your code in containers or cloud environments - Diversion is
      the tool for you. Diversion’s repository and your workspace reside in the
      cloud - only bringing the files you need into the container, quickly and
      efficiently. Your work-in-progress files are magically synchronized
      between work environments. No more cloning repositories on container
      startup, scripts synchronizing files between your local machine and the
      cloud, or losing your uncommitted files.

    title: COMPATIBLE WITH GIT
    text: >
      We know, we know - everybody works with Git. And it’s fine - Diversion
      does, too! You can seamlessly synchronize Diversion with your repo on
      Github, Gitlab or BitBucket; use “git clone” with Diversion to get a
      git-formatted repo; and even use git commands on a Diversion repo, if you
      want. So all your devops integrations will work as before.

    subtitle: ''
    text: >
      A huge mono-repo? Bring it on. Large binary files? No problem! Diversion
      can handle it with infinite scalability of the cloud. You can store
      anything you want inside a Diversion repository: multiple projects, large
      graphical assets, AI models and training data… You are not limited by what
      your local storage can handle, and by local repository processing speeds.

    text: >
      With easy to write plugins, meta-data and integrations Diversion is the
      most versatile and powerful SCM ever created. You can create your own
      org-wide plugins that magically run in the cloud and perform DevOps
      automations on your code. No need to manage Jenkins instances - your
      plugins run on our serverless platform. We’ll worry about it, so you don’t
      have to.

    title: BETTER COLLABORATION
    subtitle: ''
    text: >
      Wouldn’t you like to prevent those annoying merge conflicts before they
      happen? Or share your work-in-progress code simply by sending a link to
      your colleague - just like with Google Docs? Give and receive feedback
      easily with notes attached to the code? Having your code in the cloud
      unlocks better collaboration opportunities for everybody.

      We believe in creating positive feedback loops by giving the code to the
      community. Diversion is an open source project, and will always be open
      source. We encourage all developers to contribute feedback, feature
      requests and code (core and plugins). We will always host open source
      projects for free.
